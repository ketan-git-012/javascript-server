# MERN STACK


- MERN STACK is a javascript stack which is used for easier  and faster deployment of full stack web applications. MERN stack comprises of 4 technologies which are: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

- Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an ent-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big role in development of web applications.

## 2. Express: Back-End Framework

- Express is a nodeJS framework. Express make it easier to      write the back-end code. Express helps in designing web application along with API.

- ### Benefits:
  - Asynchronous and Single-Threaded.
  - Efficient, fast and scalable.
  - Biggest community for Node.js
  - Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.
  - Robust API.

- Command to install express package:
> npm install express --save

## 3. React: Front-End Library

- React is JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows user to code in javascript and create UI components.
- ### Benefits:
  - Virtual DOM
  - JSX
  - Components
  - High Performance
  - Developing android/ios apps
- Command to create new react application project
> npm install create-react-app --global

## 4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment
- Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server. Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages to download.
- ### Benefits:
  - Open Source JavaScript Runtime Environment.
  - Single Threading
  - Data Streaming
  - Fast
  - Highly Scalable
- To initialize Node.js application use following command
>npm init
